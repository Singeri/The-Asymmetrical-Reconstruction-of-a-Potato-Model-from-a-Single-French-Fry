When i eat i like to observe my food sometimes and while eating french fries and carefully observing them i thought to myself "Isn't there enough information about a french fry to reconstruct the potato?". This was a few months back but always an idea in my head. It was only now that i decided to solve this "problem" and it was quite fun discovering my own little equation. I doubt this equation has high accuracy, but a lot of store-bought potatoes are typically nicely-shaped so it might have a higher accuracy at store-bought potatoes.

This was just a fun little boredom project i had decided to do. Thanks for reading this. (If there are any great mistakes done in the math feel free to correct them or message me)
